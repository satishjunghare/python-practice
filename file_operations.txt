What Is Docker?
Docker is the worldâ€™s leading software 
containerization platform. 
Docker is a tool designed to make it
 easier to deploy and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package upon applications with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.
